# AnchorKit

AnchorKit is a Soroban-native toolkit for anchoring off-chain attestations to Stellar. It enables smart contracts to verify real-world events such as KYC approvals, payment confirmations, and signed claims in a trust-minimized way.


## Features

- Attestation management with replay attack protection
- Attestor registration and revocation
- Endpoint configuration for attestors
- Service capability discovery (deposits, withdrawals, quotes, KYC)
- Event emission for all state changes
- Comprehensive error handling with stable error codes

## Supported Services

Anchors can configure which services they support:

- **Deposits**: Accept incoming deposits from users
- **Withdrawals**: Process withdrawal requests
- **Quotes**: Provide exchange rate quotes
- **KYC**: Perform Know Your Customer verification

## Usage Example

```rust
// Initialize the contract
contract.initialize(&admin);

// Register an attestor/anchor
contract.register_attestor(&anchor);

// Configure supported services for the anchor
let mut services = Vec::new(&env);
services.push_back(ServiceType::Deposits);
services.push_back(ServiceType::Withdrawals);
services.push_back(ServiceType::KYC);
contract.configure_services(&anchor, &services);

// Query supported services
let supported = contract.get_supported_services(&anchor);

// Check if a specific service is supported
if contract.supports_service(&anchor, &ServiceType::Deposits) {
    // Process deposit
}
```

## Key Features

- **Attestation Management**: Register attestors, submit and retrieve attestations
- **Endpoint Configuration**: Manage attestor endpoints for off-chain integration
- **Session Management**: Group operations into logical sessions for traceability
- **Audit Trail**: Complete immutable record of all operations
- **Reproducibility**: Deterministic operation replay for verification
- **Replay Protection**: Multi-level protection against unauthorized replays
- **Mock Anchor**: Built-in simulator for testing without external APIs

## New: Session Traceability & Reproducibility

AnchorKit now includes comprehensive session management and operation tracing to ensure all anchor interactions are **reproducible** and **traceable**.

### What This Means

- **Every operation is logged** with complete context (who, what, when, result)
- **Sessions group related operations** for logical organization
- **Audit trail is immutable** for compliance and verification
- **Operations can be replayed** deterministically for reproducibility
- **Replay attacks are prevented** through nonce-based protection

### Quick Example

```rust
// Create a session
let session_id = contract.create_session(&user_address);

// Perform operations within the session
let attestation_id = contract.submit_attestation_with_session(
    &session_id,
    &issuer,
    &subject,
    &timestamp,
    &payload_hash,
    &signature
);

// Verify session completeness
let operation_count = contract.get_session_operation_count(&session_id);

// Retrieve audit logs
let audit_log = contract.get_audit_log(&0);
```

## Testing with Mock Anchor

```rust
use anchorkit::mock_anchor::MockAnchor;

// Create mock attestation data
let payload = Bytes::from_slice(&env, b"KYC approved");
let payload_hash = MockAnchor::hash_payload(&env, &payload);
let signature = MockAnchor::sign(&env, &issuer, &subject, timestamp, &payload_hash);

// Submit to contract
let id = contract.submit_attestation(&issuer, &subject, &timestamp, &payload_hash, &signature);
```

See [MOCK_ANCHOR.md](./MOCK_ANCHOR.md) for complete testing guide.

## New API Methods

### Session Management
- `create_session(initiator)` - Create new session
- `get_session(session_id)` - Get session details
- `get_session_operation_count(session_id)` - Get operation count
- `get_audit_log(log_id)` - Get audit log entry

### Session-Aware Operations
- `submit_attestation_with_session(...)` - Submit attestation with logging
- `register_attestor_with_session(...)` - Register attestor with logging
- `revoke_attestor_with_session(...)` - Revoke attestor with logging

## New Data Structures

- `InteractionSession` - Represents a session with metadata
- `OperationContext` - Captures operation details
- `AuditLog` - Complete audit entry

## New Events

- `SessionCreated` - Emitted when session is created
- `OperationLogged` - Emitted when operation is logged

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Testing

The contract includes comprehensive tests for all functionality:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Backward Compatibility

All existing methods remain unchanged. Session features are opt-in, allowing gradual adoption.

## Use Cases

### Compliance & Audit
- Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Immutable operation records
- Actor tracking for accountability

### Reproducibility
- Deterministic operation replay
- Session-based operation grouping
- Complete context preservation

### Security
- Replay attack prevention
- Multi-level protection
- Nonce-based verification

## Architecture

AnchorKit consists of:

- **Core Contract** (`src/lib.rs`) - Main contract logic
- **Storage Layer** (`src/storage.rs`) - Persistent data management
- **Event System** (`src/events.rs`) - Event definitions and publishing
- **Type System** (`src/types.rs`) - Data structures
- **Error Handling** (`src/errors.rs`) - Error codes and definitions

## Security

- Stable error codes (100-120) for API compatibility
- Replay protection at multiple levels
- Immutable audit logs
- Authorization checks on all operations
- Complete operation context for verification

## Performance

- Efficient storage with TTL management
- Minimal event data
- Sequential IDs (no hash lookups)
- Optimized for Soroban constraints
